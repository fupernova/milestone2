# Milestone 2 demo
Includes installer for desktop application and code for chrome bookmarklet.
Instructions on seetting up bookmarklet is in the milestone 2 video.
The application uses MinGW compiler, which is a Windows port of a Mac/Linux compiler library, and works on Windows. Have not tested the application for MacOS, so maybe one of y'all could help us out and see if it works? :D
